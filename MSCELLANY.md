We chose to go with the unlicense because our project is extremely simple and really isn't that complicated. Licensing something that should be set aside for massive projects where people have spent hours upon hours of time creating. We also really like the idea of someone coming along and using our code, so putting no restrictions on who can use it was fitting. 



We chose to go with the most common code of conduct to cover as many bases as possible. The Contributor Covenant is clearly well liked to be used by so many people, projects and to be translated into so many languages, so it must be doing something right. The Contributor Covenant also was neat and orderly, and we felt it overall matched the general feel of our unlicense license agreement.
