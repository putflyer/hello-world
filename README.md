Welcome to Skill Labs 7 for CMPINF0010.

This is an explanation on our program final income calculator with steps and other notes as well.

## Overview

This program has a few different things that it does in order to reach a final income. 

1. First and foremost this program will take two user inputs which are the user's name and income so we can personalize and formulate exactly what that exact person's final outcome will be. 
2. Second we will calculate the income after tax using a flat rate that we have already set in the program. 
3. Then we will subtract the initial income by the money taxed to find the final income.
4. Finally we will print out the results of the program which are the person's name and their final income. 

## How to Use it and Installation
To use this program you will need a text client and jdk or any sort of program that has jdk installed in order to run this program.
You need to make sure your inputs are valid and matching, because entering inputs of the wrong types will just crash the program obviously so be careful to read what the prompts are asking. Programs like Eclipse or JGrasp would be sufficient or text editors like Atom as well. 

This software has no licenses and is free to use for the entire public domain. We want this program to help the public. 


## How to Contribute
There are many more buffs that can be added to this program, as this is just a base.
We are looking to expand upon this program by perhaps storing the names and data of everyone who is entered for access later on.
We are also looking to expand the algorithm itself let's say to calculate a tax in a different state of the US and such.
This is an open-source project, so it would be really helpful if anyone can contribute a couple of things or add a couple of comments or suggestions for us. 
More details are listed in our code of conduct so make sure to take a look at that file as well.
